### Automated Plant Watering System

####Problem Statement
Taking care of a plant can be tough. The automatic plant watering system will remind a user to water their plant with a pop up notification,
and the user can activate the watering system via wi-fi and a web application. 

####Market Research
Similar products currently available on the Market:

The Parrot senses soil moisture and light levels, however does not have a connected watering system.
+ [Parrot Pot:  Iteration of the Parrot with a watering system] (http://www.parrot.com/usa/products/parrot-pot/)
The Parrot Pot is available in June 2016, so user reviews are not available.  
+ [Lazy Gardener Watering System:  The Lazy Gardener creates ideal growing conditions by maintaining consistent moisture content, root zone temperature and oxygen level.] (https://www.hydrofarm.com/p/AG3417)
